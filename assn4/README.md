## Part 1 - Flexbox

#### Part A - Flexbox Froggy.

#### Part B - Web page with Flexbox

The website for flexbox can be found in the `flexbox` directory.

All three pages (index, How It Works and Test Page) all use Flex.

The public URL can be found at

Flexbox is used for the overall page layout and the grid system. There is also a nested flexbox on the index page for the form elements.

## Part 2 - CSS4 Grids

The public URL can be found at

I used CSS4 auto flows to avoid having to specify precise row / column position for every element on the grid. This also allowed Bootstrap-type `col-` selectors. See the [Test page](http://wihl.github.io/DGMD-E27-S16-Assignments/assn4/css4grids/testpage.html).

## Part 3 - CSS Animation and SVG

I took [CS171](http://www.cs171.org/2016/index.html) this semester which had a large emphasis on D3 / SVG. So I combined an animated D3 / SVG [example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1353700) and added appropriate CSS Transitions and Animations.

See [http://wihl.github.io/DGMD-E27-S16-Assignments/assn4/animatesvg/index.html](http://wihl.github.io/DGMD-E27-S16-Assignments/assn4/animatesvg/index.html)

Enable the **3D transformations** by clicking on the "3D Transform" checkbox.

A **one second** color transition appears when hovering over any of the gears.

**Keyframe animation** is used twice for the counter-rotating gears in the 3D transformation.

The manipulation of an **internal SVG element** is done by hovering the inner triangle. See lines 159-164 in `index.html`.

## Thank You!

It's been a great class. I tremendous amount and will certainly recommend the class to others in the future.
